  ## Description
  When creating this project, I set out to set to create the back end for an e-commerce website, so that they can compete with other companies. By completing this assignment, I learned how to properly use Insomnia, as well as gained a greater understanding of Sequelize.

 ## Installation
  Clone this repository into your local machine,  open up the intregrated terminal by right clicking on the "db" folder, then do the following command:

  ```mysql -u root -p```

  After you type in your password, you will want to source your file using the command:

  ```source schema.sql```


  Finally, you will want to right click on server.js and open a new integrated terminal. From here, use the following commands to populate the database, and set up your node modules:

  ```npm run seed```

  ```npm i```
  
  ## Usage
  To use this project, use your server.js integrated terminal, and type in the following command:
  
  ```npm start```

 After that, open up your local Insomnia program, and run whichever commands you like!
